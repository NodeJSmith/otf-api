Simple API client for interacting with the OrangeTheory Fitness APIs.


This library allows access to the OrangeTheory API to retrieve workouts and performance data, class schedules, studio information, and bookings. It is a work in progress, currently only allowing access to GET calls, but my goal is to expand it to include POST, PUT, and DELETE calls as well.

## Installation
```bash
pip install otf-api
```
